# What is ft_printf?
This is a recreating of the powerful function printf in the C programing language. This project is far more stripped down than the original printf but it also has some rules that make this project very challenging. I will add a link to the full set of restrictions when the project nears completion.

# Can I run what is currently avaliable??
You sure can!! Just clone the repository and run this command to see the code in action:
    
    make test


You can test the input in the main.c file and compare the actual printf output with with ft_printf. I would say I'm about 80% complete with this assignment. This README will be fleshed out upon 100% completion.
